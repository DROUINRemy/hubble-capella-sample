This sample model created with Arcadia and Capella describes the Hubble Space Telescope system.

It has been created by [RÃ©my Drouin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/r%C3%A9my-drouin-ba3b1494) and presented at [Capella Days 2021](https://www.eclipse.org/capella/capella_days_2021.html).

The HUBBLE Space Telescope (HST) is a Cassegrain reflector telescope. Orbiting above the earth, HST elaborates a clear view of the universe free from the blurring and absorbing effects of the atmosphere.

This model is an example, based on public information available, in order to illustrate the journey throughout Capella.
