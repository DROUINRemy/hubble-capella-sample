## HUBBLE Space Telescope Capella Sample
This sample model created with Arcadia and Capella describes the Hubble Space Telescope system.
It has been created by [Rémy Drouin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/r%C3%A9my-drouin-ba3b1494) 


“The NASA System Engineering (SE) handbook aims to provide general guidance and information on systems engineering, as it should be applied throughout NASA. The handbook introduces 3 common technical processes. One of these, is the System Design Process, describing the stakeholders expectations, requirements definition, logical decomposition and design solution definition. The 4 activities can be supported by a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. To do so, an appropriate method and tool is necessary as the one provided by the ARChitecture Analysis & Design Integrated Approach. ARCADIA, with its modeler CAPELLA, is a MBSE solution supporting system modeling activities.  Based on 4 architectural layers, which are Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical and Physical Architecture, it is a structured architecture engineering method for defining and validating multi-domain systems.  

The HUBBLE Space Telescope (HST) is a Cassegrain reflector telescope. Orbiting above the earth, HST elaborates a clear view of the universe free from the blurring and absorbing effects of the atmosphere. In order to illustrate the journey throughout CAPELLA, the HST will be introduced, as example, based on public information available. 

# The goal is not to model the entire system as well as not apply all ARCADIA concepts, but just to introduce few diagrams of ARCADIA/CAPELLA
